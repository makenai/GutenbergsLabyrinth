# Gutenberg's Labyrinth

Created for [Codex Hackathon 2016](http://codexhackathon.com/)

3D VR Book Dungeons procedurally generated from Project Gutenberg Data. You can walk through books. You can choose to move forward or backward through a single book, but you can also move sideways into other sentences in other books that are connected through common subject matter or unexpected ways. You are on a quest for a list of 25 words or phrases. What else will you discover along the way?

Inspired by Encarta Mind Maze by Microsoft and The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges.
